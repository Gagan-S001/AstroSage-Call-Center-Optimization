# ðŸ“ž AstroSage-Call-Center-Optimization

ðŸš€ Project Overview
AstroSage, a leading astrology service provider, recently secured a â‚¹1 Crore investment to strengthen its call center operations. The goal of this project is to analyze historical call data, identify inefficiencies, and design a strategic investment plan that maximizes:
--Operational Efficiency
--Customer Satisfaction
--Profitability

This repository contains the analysis, insights, and recommendations to guide AstroSage in making data-driven decisions for sustainable growth.

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

- AstroSageâ€™s call center receives high call volumes but faces operational challenges:
- Low Call Completion Rate: Only 40.43% of calls are completed.
- Low Customer Satisfaction: Just 27.49% of users rate the service positively.
- Uneven Workload Distribution: Some agents are overburdened while others remain underutilized.
Technology Limitations: Chat services (used by 69.62% of users) have low satisfaction scores (avg. rating 2.71).

The challenge is to allocate the â‚¹1 Crore investment effectively among hiring, training, and technology upgrades to ensure maximum ROI.
